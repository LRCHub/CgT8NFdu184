I can see by the way you walk
You've never been with a man before
And I can see by the way that you look at me
That you'd sort of like to try it with me

I've got some news for you
Baby, I think your time has come
Hot, hot news for you honey
This time I won't let you run

One of these nights
One of these hot summer nights
I will be calling on you
Will you come?

I'll send my message in perfumed letters
You can't resist me
The damage has to be done

You've got to come right in
You better come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Come right in
You better come right in
I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Lonely days, lonely nights
Made me think I'll never ever survive
I've got to get you for any price
I can't get you off my mind
How hard I try

I'll be your guardian angel
I'll never let you down
I maybe a total stranger
But I'll get you in the long run

Baby, come right in
You better come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Come right in
Baby, come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

If you try me once
You'll come running for more
If you try m once
You'll come running for more

If you try him once
You'll come running for more

One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy nights
I'll lick the sweet summer sweat
From your hips

You may not like it yet
But I bet you'll get wet
It'll be worth every tear you've shed

You've got to come right in
You better come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Come right in
You better come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Come right in
Baby, come right in
And I'll come deep in
Where no one's ever been

Come right in
You better come right in
